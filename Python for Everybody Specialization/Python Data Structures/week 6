#Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.


name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
di=dict()
lst=list()

for line in handle:
    wds=line.split()
    if len(wds)>2 and wds[0]=='From':
        hr=wds[5].split(':')
        di[hr[0]]=di.get(hr[0],0)+1
    else:continue

for k,v in di.items():
    lst.append((k,v))
lst.sort()

for k,v in lst:
    print(k,v)
